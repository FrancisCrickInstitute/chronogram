\details{
The dataset supports Payne et al. Immunogenicity of standard and
extended dosing intervals of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine Cell 2021

NOTE: Changes have been made to the de-identified public dataset
(DOI: 10.17632/fyp26zjgmj.1). 1. the public data reports dates as
MM/YYYY. To build a chronogram we have assumed 15/MM/YYYY for dose
1, and used the available intervals in days to place the remaining
data in time. For illustration purposes, we need plausible
DD/MM/YYYY dates - they are not real. 2. not all of the public
dataset has been used in this example (some assays not included).
NB: If your motivation is to re-analyse Payne et al. for scientific
reasons, do not use this example dataset. Instead consult the
de-identified Mendeley data (DOI: 10.17632/fyp26zjgmj.1), or the
Cell manuscript's data and code availability statement.
