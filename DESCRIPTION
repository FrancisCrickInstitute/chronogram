Description: A system to "cast" laboratory and clinical data 
    into a tidy-like data structure. 
    This allows rapid, intuititive integration of different data 
    sources - for example, PCR, viral sequencing and participant 
    symptom diaries - and bridges the gap between a laboratory
    information management system (LIMS) and a data structure to allow testing of biological hypotheses. 
    A chronogram has a flexible design not limited to a particular
    pathogen, vaccine schedule, or experimental assays.
